     Ideas:
            ***DO THIS LAST**** Maybe read the High Score from a .txt file, and then if there is not one available, then generate one, and update the scores of the listing. 
                This way, high scores will be kept.
                Prehaps in the Exit Command within Monogame, I can make the base function that is called 
                Whenever the ESC Key is pressed to call the function within HighScore that will write the current
                score to the file before closing. Otherwise, I can just update the file whenever a new HighScore is 
                made.

            ----With the EnemyShip, make them spawn between random intervals between 50 seconds and 3 minutes.
                Maybe make it so they only appear once the player is above a certain score?

            Also, with the EnemyShip, prehaps I can randomly spawn it on either side of the screen
                When the ship starts at the left side of the screen, set MAX_THRUST_POWER to positive
                When the ship starts at the right side of the screen, set MAX_THRUST_POWER to negative

            Maybe the EnemyShips shoot lasers at the PlayerShip at Random Intervals while they are on screen
                (The Intervals will be between 3 and 5 seconds)
                Also make their Lasers not last as long. Maybe you can set this in the Laser Class's 
                Update Method, and then check laserType. If positive (player), then make it the normal three seconds
                that I have been doing. If not, then make it 1 second or something.
