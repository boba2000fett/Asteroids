     Ideas:
            ***DO THIS LAST**** Maybe read the High Score from a .txt file, and then if there is not one available, then generate one, and update the scores of the listing. 
                This way, high scores will be kept.
                Prehaps in the Exit Command within Monogame, I can make the base function that is called 
                Whenever the ESC Key is pressed to call the function within HighScore that will write the current
                score to the file before closing. Otherwise, I can just update the file whenever a new HighScore is 
                made.

            ----With the EnemyShip, make them spawn between random intervals between 50 seconds and 3 minutes.
                Maybe make it so they only appear once the player is above a certain score?

            ---Also, with the EnemyShip, prehaps I can randomly spawn it on either side of the screen
               --- When the ship starts at the left side of the screen, set MAX_THRUST_POWER to positive
                ---When the ship starts at the right side of the screen, set MAX_THRUST_POWER to negative

            ---Maybe the EnemyShips shoot lasers at the PlayerShip at Random Intervals while they are on screen
                ---(The Intervals will be between 3 and 5 seconds)
                Also make their Lasers not last as long. Maybe you can set this in the Laser Class's 
                Update Method, and then check laserType. If positive (player), then make it the normal three seconds
                that I have been doing. If not, then make it 1 second or something.

======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
July 6th, 2021

---Finish Splash and Menu Screen
	---Add Asteroids for the text to the Image

--Add in Explosions for the Rocks and EnemyShip Objects. 
	---Make an Explosion Object, and then during the Collision in PlayScreen, spawn an Explosion object at that location, and maybe make different explosions depending on the object.

---Make Rocks scroll faster as the time goes by (Maybe Score?)
---Make EnemyShips spawn sooner as time goes by (Maybe Score?)

---Maybe see if you can make the Screen fade?

Change Buttons on the HighScore Screen
	Make it so you must press a different button to confirm.
	Maybe make it so you have to press e or something to enter a character
Add in Sounds On High Score Screen
	--When Clicking Up
	--When Clicking Down
	--When Entering a Character
	---When Player Shooting 
	---When Enemy Shooting 
	--Turn Down Musescore scores of them and try again

Explosion Class: Draw either a Square or a Hexagon, and then make them spiral outwards and then back inwards.
